They arise in a variety of analytic and combinatoric problems. A common property of all three kinds is that they describe coefficients relating three different sequences of polynomials that frequently arise in combinatorics. They can all be defined as the number of partitions of n elements into k non empty subsets, where each subset is endowed with a certain kind of order.

Ordinary (signed) Stirling numbers of the first kind are commonly denoted: s(n,k). Unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind, which count the number of the permutations of n elements with k disjoint cycles, are denoted: [n k] = c(n,k) = (-1)^n-k s(n,k)

Stirling numbers of the second kind, count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k nonempty subsets: {n k} = S(n,k)

A thrid kind known as lah numbers are used to count the number of ways to partition a set of n elements into k non-empty unlabeled subsets, where each subset is endowed with linear order

It has to be noted that {n k} <= [n k] <= L(n,k)

Stirling numbers are inverses of one another and are the coefficients of the polynomials of rising and falling factorials and normal power series of x, and can be expressed as a change in basis between these three sequences
